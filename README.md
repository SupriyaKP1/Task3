# Task3

#Objective
To understand fundamental networking concepts and analyze network traffic using Wireshark
for cybersecurity monitoring and threat detection.

#Tools Used
* Wireshark
* Ubuntu Linux / Windows
* Free online networking documentation

#Concepts Covered
* IP Address and MAC Address
* DNS (Domain Name System)
* TCP and UDP protocols
* TCP three-way handshake
* Packet sniffing and traffic analysis
* Plain-text vs encrypted traffic (HTTP vs HTTPS)

#Practical Work Done
* Captured live network traffic using Wireshark
* Applied protocol filters (HTTP, DNS, TCP, UDP)
* Observed TCP three-way handshake
* Analyzed DNS queries and responses
* Identified encrypted and unencrypted traffic
* Saved packet capture files for analysis

#Deliverables
* Networking analysis report (PDF)
* Packet capture file (.pcap / .pcapng)
* Screenshots of Wireshark (optional)

#What I Learned
* How data flows across a network
* How DNS resolves domain names
* How TCP ensures reliable communication
* Why HTTPS is more secure than HTTP
* How packet sniffing helps in cybersecurity analysis

#Outcome
Gained hands-on experience in analyzing network traffic and developed a strong foundation
in networking concepts essential for cybersecurity roles.
